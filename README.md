# Introduction to lineage-entropy
Welcome to the "lineage-entropy" GitHub repository! We are so excited to have you here. This website contains python files that the Garg Lab has used to analyze data in *Lineages of embryonic stem cells show non-Markovian state transition.* We have separated our files based on their functionalities into three different folders in this repository. 

**Please note that the FASTQ files can be found in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with Bioproject: PRJNA670562.**
 
1. **Fastq_Decomplexation** folder contains python files that are used to parse FASTQ files and collapse barcodes based on their PHRED score and their similarites. 
2. **Data_Analysis** folder contains python files that are used to analyze read counts and generate figures.
3. **Pickle_Files** folder contains binary-serialized pickle files which contains collapsed and normalized barcode data. We used these pickle files in all of our downstream analyses.
